# Aerodynamics Project 1

## NACA Airfoils

The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), the predecessor to NASA, initiated around the 1930s a series of systematic studies to analyze the effects of the geometry of airfoils on its aerodynamic properties. This research led to the development of the NACA Airfoils.

In this project we focus on the NACA 4-digit airfoils. According to [1], these airfoils have good stall properties and good performance at high-speeds, although the maximum lift is relatively low and the pitching moment and drag are elevated.

A NACA 4-digit airfoil looks something like the following:

The numering of NACA 4-digit airfoils is:

## Discrete Vortex Method (DVM)

The Discrete Vortex Method (DVM) is a numerical procedure to estimate the aerodynamic properties of an airfoil. 

The thickness distribution of the airfoil is disregarded. Instead, one considers the camber line, which is discretized into $N$ different 

$$
    \frac{\partial v}{\partial t}
$$

## The project


The first project deals with 4-digit NACA airfoils. The main aerodynamic properties of these airfoils are found using the Discrete Vortex Method (DVM) and
then are compared to those properties obtained with the Thin Airfoil Theory (TAT). Airfoil properties with deployed flaps are studied as well.
