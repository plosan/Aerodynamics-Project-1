# Aerodynamics project 1

## The course
Aerodynamics is a 5th semester course in Aerospace Engineering Technologies at the ESEIAAT. In it, we review the basics of Fluid Mechanics and study
the airfoil theory. More precisely, we go over the thin airfoil theory, the finite wing theory, the aerodynamic influences of a plane and we do a brief
introduction to compressible flow.

## The project
The first project deals with 4-digit NACA airfoils. The main aerodynamic properties of these airfoils are found using the Discrete Vortex Method (DVM) and
then are compared to those properties obtained with the Thin Airfoil Theory (TAT). Airfoil properties with deployed flaps are studied as well.
