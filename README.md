# Aerodynamics Project 1

## NACA Airfoils

The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), the predecessor to NASA, initiated around the 1930s a series of systematic studies to analyze the effects of the geometry of airfoils on its aerodynamic properties. This research led to the development of the NACA Airfoils.

In this project we focus on the NACA 4-digit airfoils. According to [1], these airfoils have good stall properties and good performance at high-speeds, although the maximum lift is relatively low and the pitching moment and drag are elevated.

A NACA 4-digit airfoil looks something like the following:

The numering of NACA 4-digit airfoils is:

## Discrete Vortex Method (DVM)

The Discrete Vortex Method (DVM) is a numerical procedure to estimate some aerodynamic properties of an airfoil. The thickness distribution of the airfoil is not considered by this method, but rather the camber line, i.e. the line that approximately follows the curvature of the airfoil. Roughly speaking, this method works as follows: 

<ol>
  <li>The camber line is discretized into $N$ different panels.</li>
  <li>A lumped vortex is placed at $\frac{1}{4}$ of the length of the panel, this being responsible for the aerodynamic forces generated by the panel.</li>
  <li>The interactions between different panels vortices are accounted for.</li>
  <li>A linear system is obtained from the procedure above, the unknowns being the vorticities of panels.</li>
  <li>Once the linear system is solved, one can compute the aerodynamics loads on the airfoil.</li>
</ol> 

Further information on the DVM may be found [here](https://github.com/plosan/aerodynamics_homework_1/blob/master/notes/M2_4_Discrete_vortex_method.pdf).

## The project

The project consists in computing the main aerodynamic properties of the 4-digit NACA airfoils via the Discrete Vortex Method. Afterwards, the results are compared with those of the Thin Airfoil Theory (TAT).
